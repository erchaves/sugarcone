# Sugarcone: A sugar-sweet bundler for Dust.js

Sugarcone is a gulp utility for easy, isomorphic Dust.js templating.

- Bundles your [Dust.js](http://www.dustjs.com/) templates, partials, helpers, and filters for universal rendering on both the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server and client side.
 - Leverages the [Adaro](https://github.com/krakenjs/adaro) wrapper to support both debug mode and precompiled templates for production.
 - Need to auto-update a module but don't need a whole framework? Use sugarcone along with a tool like [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) to automagically re-render any dust partial.

## Usage
Todo: Add documentation and improve ease of use.
For now, please see this [Node/Express/Dust demo](node-express-dust) for an example of usage.
